iPhone application meant to provide easy access to many useful features to navigate and keep track of campus. Some of the features that I have been working on include:

•RPI Athletics integration with support for rosters, sport news, and schedule/results. Soon I hope to include stats, live scores, radio broadcasts, and more for specific sports that support these features!

•News Feeds from most of RPI's popular websites

•Video Feeds from RPI's YouTube Channel

•QR Code Scanner

•Troy, NY weather information

•RPI Directory (an RCOS project which I integrated!)

And coming soon..
•RPI Shuttle Tracker

•RPI Events calendar (Union, EMPAC, ECAV, and more)

•Dining hall menus/hours

•Interactive Map

•Twitter feeds from popular accounts

•WRPI Radio stream

•RPI TV Listings in a (hopefully) more mobile format

•Self-guided tour using location or QR codes (haven't decided)

All of these fit in an easily expandable home menu that mimics the default springboard layout of the iPhone. My hope is to build a stable, useful build of the iPhone version and release a fairly simple template/guide to building add ons for the app which could be implemented as a simple pull request through github. Some possible ideas could include SIS grades/schedule/account holds, further social integration, and more.
